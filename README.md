It is just a simple python file which may run using CMD or an IDE.
I build the program according to the test cases, so you just have to the give the input same way as given in test cases with number of items at start without space and price of item at last always.
It contain hardcoded rules for tax deduction, like I created a list of word which contain item to get exempted from basic tax. Similarly word 'imported' to apply ipmorted tax.
Additinally, You have to enter 'done' after which program would create result.
A demo is below.

1 box of imported chocolates at 11.25
1 imported bottle of perfume at 47.50
done
